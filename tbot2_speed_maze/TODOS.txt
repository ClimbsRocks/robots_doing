DONE! 1. Copy in working files from maze example (robot and task)

DONE. I think. 2. Modify robot env first, based from maze example, to match our new task (speed maze)

3. Modify task env, based from maze example
4. Make sure the rest of our boilerplate is set up
    A. launch
    B. config
5. Run it and see what breaks!


Where we're stuck right now:
    There's some broken logic about our observation space.
    Basically, we get readings of len 144 from our laser
    We want to turn that into something smaller and easier to action on
    So we use something called new_ranges to figure out some logic for turning 144 into something smaller.
    We need to create an observation_space that is the same len as our final observation size
    But there's a bug in how they calculate the len of our readings, and it's all inconsistent.
    Goal: make the len of our laser readings consistent- let's say 14 for now, and let's just do this the stupid simple way- no averaging, or intelligently including/excluding the ends/1 off of the ends, etc.
